#### The Carpentries

<br><br>
<img src="https://carpentries.org/assets/img/TheCarpentries.svg">
<br><br>

##### *Official logo of The Carpentries (carpentries.org)*

The Carpentries (https://carpentries.org), brings Software, Data and Library Carpentry together under an umbrella to teach foundational computational, coding, and data science skills to people worldwide. We are a diverse, global community of volunteer Instructors, helpers, Trainers, Maintainers, champions, member organisations, supporters, and staffs.

#### CarpentryConnect

CarpentryConnect Heidelberg is being organised as the second European CarpentryConnect together with the BioNT Community event, under the theme "Community-led training beyond Academia". 

CarpentryConnect events are the regional conferences, organised to strengthen local communities by creating opportunities for their member to exchange knowledge and build computational skills. These in-person events allow people to discuss topics of local interest and get to know about each other's work in an informal setup. The organisers of such events aim to provide a diverse and inclusive environment for learning, skill-building, and networking for the members interested in computational techniques to enhance the quality and efficiency of research and training. 


#### Catering

One of the most important conference supplies, food and beverages, has been arranged for the conference during the breaks for the registered participants. We will take care of the different dietary requirements if you have mentioned it in your registration. Please let the organisers know if you'd like to amend your specific dietary requirements. 

#### Code of Conduct

As a member and conference participant, you are requested to familiarize yourself with The Carpentries' [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By participating at this conference, participants accept to abide by [The Carpentries' Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form or behaviour to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. 

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to the conference Code of Conduct chairs (Toby Hodges, Renato Alves and Rabea Müller) at the conference in person or by [email](https://biont-training.eu/CarpentryConnect2024.html#conduct). They  will take the appropriate action to address the situation. You can also make an anonymous report via this [reporting form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdi0wbplgdydl_6rkVtBIVWbb9YNOHQP_XaANDClmVNu0zs-w/viewform).


#### Community Event BioNT 

This event will be the only in-person instance hosted by BioNT. The consortium aims to foster community exchange and building, essential component of the sustainability strategy for training and non-training activities.

#### Currency

The currency used in Germany is Euro. 

You can use your credit or debit card in almost all places, including for travel ticket purchases and at restaurants. However, some places might require a debit card within the German circuit (Maestro), so we recommend always having some cash on hand when going around. Additionally, some places might not accept credit cards or may have a minimum amount required for using them.


#### Curriculum Development

The Carpentries provide some Lesson Sprint Recommendations as an appendix to the Curriculum Development [Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/lesson-sprint-recommendations.html). While most of the recommendations in the document are beyond the scope of the Curriculum development sessions at CarpentryConnect, there may still be some useful information. Particularly important before the event are the following considerations:

1) Define the scope of the content to be worked on. For example, you can use issue labels, a milestone, or a project board to gather issues that you want participants to work on, ensuring they are realistically achievable within the available time.
2) Consider what additional information will be important for participants to have before they join. For instance, what can you share about the target audience and objectives of your lesson or curriculum? What is the scope of the lesson, and what is specifically out of scope?


The Curriculum development session will start on the second day at 16:15 with an explanation on how to contribute and a small introduction of the different sessions

### D: Diversity, Data Carpentry

#### Diversity 

The Carpentries is a community of volunteer instructors, helpers, Trainers, Maintainers, champions, member organisations, supporters, and staff, of diverse background, nationality, ethnicity, gender and various identity groups. We are working hard to ensure that everyone feels welcome at the BioNT Community event and CarpentryConnect 2024. Feel free to reach out to the organisers if they can improve your experience as a member at The Carpentries and CarpentryConnect. Attendees must be prepared to abide by our Code of Conduct (also see *Carpentries, Code of Conduct, Emergency, Inclusion*).

#### Heidelberg
Heidelberg is a city in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, situated on the river Neckar in south-west Germany. Located about 78 km south of Frankfurt, Heidelberg is the fifth-largest city in Baden-Württemberg. Heidelberg is part of the densely populated Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region.

Heidelberg University, founded in 1386, is Germany's oldest and one of Europe's most reputable universities. Heidelberg is a scientific hub in Germany and home to several internationally renowned research facilities adjacent to its university, including the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and four Max Planck Institutes. The city has also been a hub for the arts, especially literature, throughout the centuries, and it was designated a "City of Literature" by the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.

Heidelberg was a seat of government of the former Electorate of the Palatinate and is a popular tourist destination due to its romantic cityscape, including Heidelberg Castle, the Philosophers' Walk, and the Baroque old town.

For tourist information, [visit this webpage](https://www.heidelberg-marketing.de/en/).

#### Helpdesk

We will have a helpdesk at the venue where you can get all the information that you may need during the conference. We will also have a designated Welcome Team, who will help you during the day to get orientated at the conference venue. For any request for special needs and help, get in touch with the organisers.

### I: Icebreaker, Inclusion

#### Icebreaker

Many people coming to the BioNT Community Event & CarpentryConnect will be meeting for the first time. We want to make sure that everyone who comes to the event feels a sense of belonging right from the start. To get a head start to networking, we have planned an icebreaker event for everyone to connect with a small group of people to swap stories about themselves. You will also have several opportunities for face-to-face networking and interaction with other members during the conference.

#### Inclusion

We want to create an inclusive and welcoming environment at the conference. We are providing [Inclusivity Tickets](https://survey.bio-it.embl.de/195458?lang=en) that will lower the costs of registrations. We are collecting full details to identify needs mobility, accessibility and dietary preferences during registration. Feel free to reach out to the organisers and staff if they can improve your participation at this event. (also see *BioNT, Carpentries, Code of Conduct, Diversity, Emergency*)


### J: Join us

#### Join BioNT as ambassador
The vision of BioNT is to provide a high-quality training program and community for digital skills relevant to the biotechnology industry and biomedical sector. BioNT will structure and consolidate the communication with specific workplaces by proposing to trainees and trainers the role of “BioNT Ambassadors”.

The benefit for ambassadors will be to be the first to know about BioNT courses and initiative (so to have the opportunity to attend multiple courses). In addition, the ambassador will encourage the participation of multiple people from the same institution, to facilitate the blended format for participation and support the creation of local communities. The number of ambassadors will be also tracked as an indicator.

If you're interested in joining us, please reach out via email to [contact@biont-training.eu](mailto:contact@biont-training.eu).


#### Join The Carpentries

There are several ways to become a member of [The Carpentries community](https://carpentries.org/community/) and support its work. At CarpentryConnect, take a chance to talk to other members of the community in order to identify projects where you can contribute or benefit from. See [here](https://carpentries.org/join/) for more detail. If you have just completed your instructor training, your participation to this conference will be counted towards your checkout procedure.

### K: Keynote Speakers, Knowledge sharing

#### Keynote Speakers

We have [fantastic keynote speakers](https://biont-training.eu/CarpentryConnect2024.html#eventHead) lined up for you at our event. Our 3 speakers are: **Malvika Sharan** (Senior Researcher (The Alan Turing Institute)), **Radhika S Khetani** (Director of Data Science Learning (AstraZeneca)), **Yanina Bellini Saibene** (Community Manager (rOpenSci)). We are very excited to have these leaders from their field at the BioNT Community event and CarpentryConnect 2024 and are looking forward to their talks. See the [official website](https://biont-training.eu/CarpentryConnect2024.html#eventHead) for more details.

#### Knowledge sharing 

We, as organisers, have put a lot of efforts into making sure that you get several opportunities to learn new skills and ideas while expanding your network. In this 3-day high-intensity conference you will learn from: (1) the experts, through keynote talks, skill-up session, and workshops, (2) the new members, by sharing ideas with each other at discussion/breakout sessions and get tips from the session leads and other attendees. At the conference, you will be surrounded by the community leaders and trainers, and everyone is seeking to learn. We can assure you that you will get much more than 'just another conference experience', if you reach out to your neighbor during coffee breaks, at the watercoolers, while sharing charging stations, at lunches, in the breakout rooms, and at conference receptions.

### L: Lightning talks, Library Carpentry

#### Lightning talks

The lightning talk session will take place on the first day of the conference from 16:30 - 17:15 (CEST) . Each lightning talk presenter will get 3 minutes to present their topics.

This event a fantastic opportunity to interact with other Instructors and Trainers from around the world. 


#### Mini-hackathon

There will be 7 sessions taking place over the third day of the conference. The sessions will be running in parallel to each other. Take a look at [the current program](https://biont-training.eu/CarpentryConnect2024.html#programme) to make sure that you know which session  you might be attending and where you would like to contribute.

This session will start with an explanation on how to contribute and a presentation of the different sessions on the 13th of November at 16:15 (also see *Curriculum Development*).

### N: New Members, Name Tags

#### New Members

Are you new to The Carpentries? Do you want to learn more about the organisation and how you can support it? CarpentryConnect is the place for you. It can be quite daunting if you don't know anyone, but the community has a history of being very friendly and inclusive, so don't be afraid to introduce yourself. You will be surprised how many lasting collaborations you will make at the conference. Take advantage of the social events and ice-breaking session, and when in doubt, contact the organisers.

Are you new to BioNT? Refer to *Join as Ambassador* for information about how to engage with the BioNT project.

#### Name Tags

Name tags are a great way for participants to strike up conversations with other participants or volunteers. You can collect your name tag at the registration desk. Don't forget to bring your registration ticket. Our name tags will have a section to add your preferred pronoun(s) and add a sticker to indicate if you don’t want to be photographed at the event. As a participant, be respectful to each other by using the correct name and pronouns. Ask – if you don't know how to pronounce someone's name, maybe they will share an interesting story behind their name.

The name tag will also include information about your preferred sessions

### O: Online participation, Organising Committee


#### Online participation
To ensure the event is accessible and inclusive, we have decided to make it hybrid. If you're unable to attend the conference in person, you can participate fully online. Please note that breaks and the poster session will take place exclusively onsite. However, we will offer opportunities for virtual interaction during these times. Posters will also be provided in PDF format, and a collaborative document will be available where you can post questions and connect with other participants.

Further information will be communicated soon.

#### Organising Committee

The organiser of this event is [BioNT](https://biont-training.eu) in collaboration with The Carpentries. Silvia Di Giorgio, the Training and community manager, is the chair of the conference, who is working together with EMBL members, with Institute staff and community members to make this conference a success with your participation. The other members of the organisation committee are Toby Hodges, Isabela Paredes Cisneros, Lisanna Paladin, Renato Alves, Rabea Müller, Teresa Müller and Giacomo Peru. They’ll be wearing a t-shirt with the conference logo. Don’t forget to say ‘Hello’ to them!

### P: Pronouns, Pacman Rule, Photography, Posters, Power adapters, Post-conference

#### Pronouns

It has become a general practice to share pronouns (He/She/They/Ze etc.) on conference name tags. For those unfamiliar with the practice of sharing pronouns at the conference, it goes something like this: “Name: Silvia Di Giorgio. Pronouns: she/her”. This practice is important for making sure that we use correct pronouns, specifically for our trans, queer, and gender non-conforming community members you will meet at BioNT Community event and CarpentryConnect.

#### Pacman Rule

We know that coming into a conference alone or for the first time can be a little intimidating. You may not know anyone but it seems like everyone else knows lots of people. To ensure that everyone feels welcome and gets an opportunity to get to know other participants, we invite you to ‘stand like a Pacman’. Known as [Pacman rule](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/), this idea suggests that “when standing as a group of people (during social breaks), always leave room for 1 person to join your group”. So, stand like a pacman, or maybe create the largest pacman circle of the event. 


#### Photography 

You are allowed to take photographs at the conference. Make sure that you do not disturb any session or others in the process. We will offer a specific stickers for the badges for those who **don't want to be photographed**. Be respectful of their decision and don't take/post their pictures on social media. A few volunteers will be taking pictures to be included to the official collection, you are welcome to join them. If you want to post pictures on social media, use the hastag #CCHD2024 to tag the conference, so that other attendees and those who couldn't join the conference can find your posts.

#### Posters

We will have a poster session and a designated area for the display of posters. You should use the A0 poster size (vertical). Any other specifications will be added if required. The poster session will take place on the first evening of the conference, on the 12th of November from 17:45 to 19:00 (CEST)

Further information will be provided to each poster presenter closer to the event.

#### Power Adapters

1) Bring a types C and F (compatible) power adapter. Check the requirements [here](https://www.electricalsafetyfirst.org.uk/guidance/advice-for-you/when-travelling/travel-adaptor-for-germany/).
2) If you are using your laptop for a presentation, bring your adapter to connect it with the projector (HDMI or VGA).
3) If you have any errors while running your program, send an email or ask for help in the designated channels.

We will have on-site technical support at the conference. A few volunteers will be willing to help you with any technical difficulties that you might face at the conference. You can inquire about this at the helpdesk or by directly approaching the organisers.

#### Post-conference 

The post-conference period will be equally crucial to evaluate the success of the conference. The organisers will share with you a post-conference survey (from the first day already) to learn about your experiences from this conference and suggestions for the next one. The organisers will also publish a post conference report and accept blog submission from the conference participants.

### Q: Queries, Quiet and Prayer Rooms

#### Questions

Get in touch with the [organisers](mailto:programme-biont@embl.de) if you have any specific questions about the conference. Take note of our communication channels for queries and updates (email and slack).

Rainfall is moderate, with approximately 49mm expected over the month, so it's advisable to bring a waterproof jacket or umbrella. There's also a chance of snowfall so be prepared. Layered clothing and waterproof shoes and jackets are recommended to stay comfortable in the variable weather conditions.


#### Workshops

There will be 5 Workshops sessions taking place over the first 2 days of the conference. Several sessions will be running in parallel to each other. Take a look at [the current program](https://biont-training.eu/CarpentryConnect2024.html#programme) to make sure that you know which session  you might be attending and where you would like to contribute.

#### Wireless
Wireless networks are available at the conference venues. Venue specific wireless information will be shared at the conference sites. You will also be able to use [Eduroam](https://www.eduroam.org/about/connect-yourself/) which should be set up at your home institution before your travel to Heidelberg. 

If you do not have Eduroam, don't worry—alternative internet access will be provided for everyone. Further details will be shared soon.

#### Waste minimisation

Large events are known to produce a large amount of waste material in several stages, starting from traveling overseas to using paper cups. We have tried to take the philosophy of ‘sustainability’ by adopting a few ideas in our organisation workflow, which includes reusing lanyard and badges, not using plastic packaging and cutlery for the catering, minimising the printed materials, and be conscious of efforts made by our participants. We encourage you to avoid buying packaged water bottles and coffee mugs, by bringing your own reusable bottle and coffee mugs at the conference.
